# Stock-Market-Price-Predictor
# Description:
This project predicts stock prices for Tata Motors, BHEL, Zomato, TCS, and OIL using Linear Regression, SVM, Random Forest, and XGBoost. We trained models on historical data, evaluated using MSE and R-squared. Future enhancements include deep learning techniques like LSTM for better predictions.

Introduction

This repository contains the research paper, code, and results for the project "Stock Market Prediction Using Machine Learning: A Comparative Study of Supervised Algorithms." We focus on predicting stock prices for companies such as Tata Motors, BHEL, Zomato, TCS, and OIL using various machine learning models.
